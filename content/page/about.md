My name is Isaac Zhou. I love data and coding. This website contains the tutorials/notes for a couple of programming languages:

- Python
- Javascript
- R
- SQL

Two of my favorite editors emacs and jupyter notebook are used to create contents. I used to use Pelican for site generation but recently I migrated to Hugo for its speed and simpler workflow.

### my other sites

I have two other site [ACE big data](http://www.acebigdata.com/) is more project based and covers more advanced topics in Data Science; [Isaac Zhou](http://www.isaaczhou.com) is my personal blog.
